# BluetoothAPTXForLinux Aptx support for linux with FFMpeg and bluez-alsa
To checkout : git submodule init

To install :
Install all the packages required to build FFmpeg (we require to build it because the Aptx codec is very recent and not included in packages distribs), bluez-alsa and openaptx

To build : ./build
To install openaptx and bluez-alsa : ./install (this requires root)
